              <h3>Python</h3>
              <p>
                  Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
                  Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.
                  Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear,
                  logical code for small and large-scale projects.

              <h3>Java</h3>
              <p>
                  Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as
                  few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to
                  let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), [17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
                  platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.

              <h3>C Language </h3>
              <p>
                 C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming,
                  lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs
                  that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications
                  previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various
                  application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded
                  systems.

              <h3>C++ Language</h3>
              <p>
                  C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. C++ was
                  developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level
                  of control over system resources and memory.
